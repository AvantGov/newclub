updating the ol' resume.

DEV NOTES 
- will need to build out state handling to hide the comp and then show it again 

- will need to find a way to play the song in the application and maybe show a playbar? 

- could probably still use BPM just will need to divide it substantially.

- we will need a banner component in order to notify users that this is a mobile application
